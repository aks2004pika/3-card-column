### What I learned

This was my first project. I'm just a beginner in this world of coding. Doing this project and completing it the very first try was a achivement for me.

The thing that I learned while doing this project was to align things on the center. Centering things was task for me. I got just what I hoped for i.e. learning new skills and practising that I already know.

### Continued development

After this project, I would be looking for something that challenges my skills with images. Dealing with images has been quite confusing for me and that'a what the next thing that I would be focusing on.
